We will setup the Express framework using the packet manager called npm

- Using the bash console, go to this folder (cd /var/lib/cloud9/node_projects/Exercises/05_Express)

- First you need to install express in the project folder, type the following:
        npm install express

        

It is very complicated to create a proper folder structure to run an MVC web app, so we will use a tool to generate it
- Download the tool by typing:
        npm install express-generator -g
        
        The -g option will install this tool globally (you can use it for any other project)
        

- Type in the following to create your MVC web server:
        express MyWebServerName -ejs
        
        We use the -ejs option in order to use encapsulated javascript later on
        
- You can now navigate through the folder tree structure and see what goes where
