Open sockets/sockets.js and take a close look at the instructions
Note how the callback functions are nested inside other callback functions
The following occurs

- The web server will start our C++ as a child process. This means that when we turn off
our web server this process will be terminated, which is exactly what we want.

- The web server (our Node app) is also the IPC server. The C++ is the IPC client. Note how 
we initiate the server using var unixServer = net.createServer(function(client) {...

- When the C++ app sends data on the socket, the following callback is called:
client.on('data',function(data){
Note how we parse the data and send them to the web client using socket.io
