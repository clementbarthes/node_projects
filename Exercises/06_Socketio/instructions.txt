In this project socket.io is already installed in the express framework

Open socket.js,  public/script.js and view/index.ejs

Keep in mind that socket.js runs on the server (the BBB) and script.js runs on the client (the web page opened by the user)

In index.ejs, note that a button exists with the ID "socketTest". When the user clicks this button, it will run
a callback function in script.js

In this callback function, you should use socket.emit to send a message to the server
